## From Turing machines and Lambda calculus to today's programming languages

* Turing machines can be seen as the natural ancestors of procedural and object oriented languages

* lambda calculus formalizes the key operations in functional languages (although function notation as used in mathematics has been around for much longer)

---
## Turing machines $\Rightarrow$ Random access machines  $\Rightarrow$ today's computers
- The Turing machine's tape and store is replaced by directly addressable memory
- machine and the assembler languages follow
- procedural languages (compiled or interpreted)
- object oriented languages help encapsulating state and reuse code via inheritance mechanisms

---
## Combinators and Lambda Calculus

* functions, via application and composition
* substitution mechanisms instead of overwriting of memory state
* simpler equivalent formalism: combinators
	* S f g x = (f x) (g x)
	* K x y = x
	* I x = x
* naming of a function separated from specification of how a function operates: $\lambda$ x . x

## Turing Machines, Lambda Calculus, Combinators all have the same computational power

* they can *emulate* each other: an interpreter for any of them can be written in another formalism
* they are all called *Turing Complete* formalisms
* the same applies to *all* programming languages
* what distinguishes them is *expressiveness*
